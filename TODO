-------------------------------------------------------------

admin area, show doll and the location points on it, can drag and drop the points to move where they are at

[ ] free floating image options for scars and things that you can place wherever you want

when adding an image, pick which body type, it then displays the body doll with the location points for it. then click on which body point the image will attach to. the image then appears at that location. can then pick rotation and reflection for that location
	• can then add a new connection and pick a body/location point/rotation/reflection

use code splitting!

free floating images, can place a scar anywhere and can rotate it whoever you want
